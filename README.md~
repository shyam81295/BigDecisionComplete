## Prerequisites

To make use of these files, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed on your workstation:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com)

## What It Does

Together with the prerequisites listed above, the scripts contained herein will let you create a new VM with a simple `vagrant up` that:

* Is configured with a static IP address on your local LAN (default 196.165.75.76) so you don't need to constantly be looking up new DHCP-assigned addresses each time it restarts
* Has a complete MySQL 5 setup (client and server) installed
* Has a complete Apache 2 setup installed (with mod_rewrite)
* Has a complete PHP5 setup (both mod_php and CLI versions) installed, with the following modules:
    * php5-curl
    * php5-gd
    * php5-imagick
    * php5-mysql
    * php5-sqlite
    * php5-xcache
    * php5-xmlrpc
* Installs the latest version of the WordPress software in /vagrant, so you can work with local files via your favorite editor/IDE; sets up symlink to it at /var/www/wordpress`so Apache can find it
* Has a MySQL database (name: "wordpress") and database user (name: "user_wp"; password: "wordpress") for WordPress to make use of
* Has a configuration file in `/root/.my.cnf` to allow the root user to log into MySQL as root without needing to enter a username or password
* Has an Apache virtual host configured and enabled to serve WordPress

So, once the box is provisioned, all you need to do is go to 196.165.75.76 in your browser to begin the famous WordPress 5-minute install.

## Getting Started

To begin, create an empty directory and clone the files in this repository into it.

Then just run the command `vagrant up` and your VM should bootstrap itself into existence, ready to work with. 

[More information on working with Vagrant VMs, including how to shell into a running VM and shut it down safely, is available in the Vagrant documentation.](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html)

## Customization/Configuration

**If you use the default box, no configuration should be required to get up and running.** However, in the file named `Vagrantfile`, you *may* wish to change the following:

* If you want to use an IP address other than 192.168.50.50, replace that address with the one you wish to use in two places:
    * `Vagrantfile`, on line 9
    * `vagrant-inventory`, on line 2

Finally, it's not necessary in most common use scenarios, but if for some reason you wish to change the configuration of the Apache virtual host or the MySQL configuration for the root user, you can find the templates used to generate those configuration files in the `templates` subdirectory.

If you wish to modify or extend the basic logic that provisions the system -- add new packages, say -- all that logic is in the file `setup.yml`. This file is an Ansible "playbook," so you can make use of any of Ansible's modules or features there. For more information on how to work with Ansible playbooks, refer to their ["Intro to Playbooks"](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks.html) document. [A complete reference of all modules available within an Ansible playbook](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/modules.html) is also available.
